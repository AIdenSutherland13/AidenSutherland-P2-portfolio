Ever!\nIdeally, load the raw data into R and do all changes there with code, so everything is automatically reproducible and documented.\nSometimes, you need to edit the files in the format you got. For instance, Excel files are sometimes so poorly formatted that it’s close to impossible to read them into R, or the persons you got the data from used color to code some information, which of course won’t import into R. In those cases, you might have to make modifications in a software other than R. If you need to make edits in whatever format you got the data (e.g. Excel), make a copy and place those copies in a separate folder, AND ONLY EDIT THOSE COPIES. Also, write down somewhere the edits you made.\nAdd as many sub-folders as suitable. If you only have a single processing step, one sub-folder for processed data is enough. If you have multiple stages of cleaning and processing, additional sub-folders might be useful. Adjust based on the complexity of your project.\nI suggest you save your processed and cleaned data as RDS or RDA/Rdata files. This preserves coding like factors, characters, numeric, etc. If you save as CSV, that information would get lost. However, CSV is better for sharing with others since it’s plain text. If you do CSV, you might want to write down somewhere what each variable is.\nSee here for some suggestions on how to store your processed data:\nhttp://www.sthda.com/english/wiki/saving-data-into-r-data-format-rds-and-rdata"

I suggest you save your processed and cleaned data as RDS or RDA/Rdata files. This preserves coding like factors, characters, numeric, etc. If you save as CSV, that information would get lost. However, CSV is better for sharing with others since it’s plain text. If you do CSV, you might want to write down somewhere what each variable is.\nSee here for some suggestions on how to store your processed data: http://www.sthda.com/english/wiki/saving-data-into-r-data-format-rds-and-rdata\n\nsave_data_location &lt;- here::here(\"starter-analysis-exercise\",\"data\",\"processed-data\",\"processeddata.rds\")\nsaveRDS(processeddata, file = save_data_location)\n\nNote the use of the here package and here command to specify a path relative to the main project directory, that is the folder that contains the .Rproj file. Always use this approach instead of hard-coding file paths that only exist on your computer.\n\n\nNotes\nRemoving anyone observation with “faulty” or missing data is one approach. It’s often not the best. based on your question and your analysis approach, you might want to do cleaning differently (e.g. keep observations with some missing information)."

    "text": "This Quarto file loads the cleaned data and does some exploring.\nI’m only showing it the way where the code is included in the file. As described in the processing_code materials, I currently prefer the approach of having R code in a separate file and pulling it in.\nBut I already had this written and haven’t yet re-done it that way. Feel free to redo and send a pull request on GitHub :)\nAgain, it is largely a matter of preference and what makes the most sense to decide if one wants to have code inside Quarto files, or as separate R files. And sometimes, an R script with enough comments is good enough and one doesn’t need a Quarto file.\nAlso note that while here I split cleaning and exploring, this is iterative. You saw that as part of the processing, we already had to explore the data somewhat to understand how to clean it. In general, as you explore, you’ll find things that need cleaning. As you clean, you can explore more. Therefore, at times it might make more sense to combine the cleaning and exploring code parts into a single R or Quarto file. Or split things in any other logical way.\nAs part of the exploratory analysis, you should produce plots or tables or other summary quantities for the most interesting/important quantities in your data. Depending on the total number of variables in your dataset, explore all or some of the others. Figures produced here might be histograms or density plots, correlation plots, etc. Tables might summarize your data.\nStart by exploring one variable at a time. Then continue by creating plots or tables of the outcome(s) of interest and the predictor/exposure/input variables you are most interested in. If your dataset is small, you can do that for all variables.\nPlots produced here can be scatterplots, boxplots, violinplots, etc. Tables can be simple 2x2 tables or larger ones.\n\nSetup\n\n#load needed packages. make sure they are installed.\nlibrary(here) #for data loading/saving\n\nWarning: package 'here' was built under R version 4.3.3\n\n\nhere() starts at C:/Users/Administrator/Documents/GitHub/AidenSutherland-P2-portfolio/AidenSutherland-P2-portfolio\n\nlibrary(dplyr)\n\n\nAttaching package: 'dplyr'\n\n\nThe following objects are masked from 'package:stats':\n\n    filter, lag\n\n\nThe following objects are masked from 'package:base':\n\n    intersect, setdiff, setequal, union\n\nlibrary(skimr)\n\nWarning: package 'skimr' was built under R version 4.3.3\n\nlibrary(ggplot2)\n\nWarning: package 'ggplot2' was built under R version 4.3.3\n\n\nLoad the data.\n\n#Path to data.

I have grown up in San Antonio for most of my life, however my dad was stationed in Hawaii for about 3 and a half years when I was in elementary schools, which started my lifelong addiction to Hawaiian food. I have a younger sister and a twin brother, one day ill send him to class in my stead and y’all will never know. I am kind of a military brat, which (if you have lived in San Antonio for long) isn’t uncommon. I enjoy playing video games, going to any body of water, and eating lots of amazing food. As of right now I am in the process of accruing certifications and waiting to join the USAF as an officer."

    "text": "This folder contains code to do some simple exploratory analysis and statistical analysis on the processed/cleaned data. The code produces a few tables and figures, which are saved in the results folder.\nIt’s the same code done 3 times:\n\nFirst, there is an R script that you can run which does all the computations.\nSecond, there is a Quarto file which contains exactly the same code as the R script.\nThird, my current favorite, is a Quarto file with an approach where the code is pulled in from the R script and run.\n\nThe last version has the advantage of having code in one place for easy writing/debugging, and then being able to pull the code into the Quarto file for a nice combination of text/commentary and code.\nEach way of doing this is a reasonable approach, pick whichever one you prefer or makes the most sense for your setup. Whichever approach you choose, add ample documentation/commentary so you and others can easily understand what’s going on and what is done."

(This is often called a Codebook.) For this simple example, the codebook is given as a second sheet in the Excel file.\nThis raw data-set should generally not be edited by hand. It should instead be loaded and processed/cleaned using code."
