title: "Background"
---
I have grown up in San Antonio for most of my life, however my dad was stationed in Hawaii for about 3 and a half years when I was in elementary schools, which started my lifelong addiction to hawaiian food. 
I have a younger sister and a twin brother, one day ill send him to class in my stead and yall will never know. I am kind of a military brat, which (if you have lived in San Antonio for long) isn't uncommon.
I enjoy playing video games, going to any body of water, and eating lots of amazing food.
